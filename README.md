### Contributors: Daniel Kane, John Sebastian, Declan Peters 
This is a web design project using all of the best coding practices we have learned in Web Devlopment. It uses primarily HTML and CSS, with JS support for nav items. 

This is an effort to design a real-world web application for a barber shop. We use all of the techniques we have learned to create a ficitonal, but practical, website for a barber shop.
